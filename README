This Google App Engine servlet lets you upload a PNG or JPG file (or
supply a URL to a PNG or JPG) and generates an ASCII-art version of
the image; it uses the iascii encoder package.  The generated image
uses only text characters (one per pixel) and will be displayed in
fixed width font inside <pre> tags.  The "resize" package and some of
the convenience functions were copied from Moustachio
(http://moustach-io.appspot.com/)
